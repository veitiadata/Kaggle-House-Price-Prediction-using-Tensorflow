Analysis and walkthrough of this popular Kaggle competition, implementing a Deep Neural Network with Tensorflow.

Decided to expand on the basic Tensorflow/keras implementation and create the DNN using the core library; this approach helped me understand the building blocks of the neural network and exposed me to the extensive configurability and complexity of the Tensorflow core library.
